# FIZZBUZZ
 
The standard Fizzbuzz programming challenge, built in Python.

## Overview
In Fizzbuzz, the player counts up from 1, however rather than saying any number that's divsible by 3 they say "Fizz" instead. Instead of saying a number that's divisble by 5 they say "Buzz" instead. Where the number is divisible by 3 and 5 they say Fizzbuzz.

The sequence therefore goes:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

This program generates a Fizzbuzz sequence.

## Customisation
In this program, the Fizz and Buzz values are stored in a python list:
fizzbuzz_array=[['Fizz',3],['Buzz',5]]

Users can specify their own values for Fizz and Buzz, and the program will accept any number of Fizz's and Buzz's that the user wishes to generate.

They also have the option to define the start, end and steps of the number sequence:

#Define what number you want to start the output at
output_start = 1

#Define what number you want to end the output on
output_end = 200

#Define what steps you want to count up in
output_step = 1
